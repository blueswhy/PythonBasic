I heard that you are settled down
and you find a girl, and you are married now.
I heard that your dreams came true,
Guess she give you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back, or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up of the blue uninvited.
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you would see my face and that you would be reminded that for me,
it isn't over.
Never mind, I will find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me I beg,I'll remember you said.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.

You know how the time flies,
only yesterday was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summer haze.
Bouned by the surprise of our glory days.
I hate to turn up of the blue uninvited.
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you would see my face and that you would be reminded that for me,
it isn't over.
Never mind, I will find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me I beg,I'll remember you said.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
Nothing compares, no worries or cares,regrets and mistakes that are memories made .
Who would have konwn how bitter sweet,this would taste.
Never mind, I will find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg I'll remember you said.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
Never mind I will find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg I will remember you said.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead.PS: It is the end of the song
